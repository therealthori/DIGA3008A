        <h3>Week 1 Blog Post</h3>

        <p>My experience with setting up Git was good but confusing due to my VS Code not having Git. However, I am very grateful that the tutors were able to help me set up my VSCode and Git. Publishing to Pages was easy, due to the use of git and the live server, it was very nice to navigate.</p>

        <p>Alan Turing's paper asks the big question: "Can machines think?" But instead of trying to define "thinking," he suggests a simple test called the Imitation Game (now called the Turing Test).

            The Imitation Game (Turing Test)
            - Someone asks questions of two hidden players: one human, and one machine.
            - If the human is unable to tell which is the machine, then the machine is "thinking" like the human.
            
            Main Ideas in Simple Words
            1. Machines Can Imitate Human Thinking
               - Computers accept orders, but if they are able to answer questions like the human, then they can be called intelligent.
            
            2. Objections (Disagreements) and Turing's Responses
            - "Machines have no soul" - Turing claims this restricts what God would be able to do.
            - "Machines just follow rules, so they can't be creative" - But humans follow rules in thinking and learning too!
            - "Computers will never have emotions" - Turing claims that emotion is irrelevant; what does matter is whether the machine behaves like a human.
            - "Machines can't make mistakes" - But they can learn from errors and even "simulate" erring like a human being.
            
            Machines Can Learn! - Instead of teaching a machine to perform like an adult, why not teach it like a child?
            - A learning machine could improve over time, as humans do.
            
            Turing's Prediction
            He believed that by the year 2000, computers would be so advanced that most people would not be able to tell if they were talking to a machine or a human.
            Final Thought - Turing explains we should be comparing machines 'what they do' and not 'how they work' on the inside. If a machine acts like a human, then why not think that it is "thinking"?

            <p>October 29th, 1991, was the start of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) which was created by Tim Berners-Lee as it publicly links to the World Wide Web (WWW) which was also invented by Tim Berners-Lee. March 18th, 1992, was when Berners-Lee introduces the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), formally known as URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), as how web addresses are constructed as a standard to navigating decentralized networks. </p>

            <p>My goal from this course is to develop my coding skills more and understanding the basics of web development in order to create fully functional website.</p>

        <h3>Blog 2</h3>

        <p>Stuart Moulthrop's essay examines the advent of hypertext and its potential as a revolutionary new medium. By using Marshall McLuhan's paradigm of media analysis, he investigates what hypertext adds, replaces, recovers, and becomes when pushed to its limits.</p>
            
            <p>Hypertext's Promise - 
                Hypertext was envisioned as an interactive, non-linear system that would allow users to read and write interactively, transcending books' rigid form.
                Early advocates such as Ted Nelson envisioned it as a means to democratize information, building an open and networked "docuverse" where users freely contributed and accessed information.
            </p>
            
            <p>Commercialization & Corporate Influence -
                Whereas hypertext was envisioned as a device for liberation and unencumbered sharing of ideas, it soon became centralized.
                Rather than a people-driven revolution, big business such as Sony and AOL have come to control online spaces, controlling access to content.
            </p>
            <p>Hypertext vs. Traditional Media - 
                Moulthrop argues that hypertext is not replacing books but television, as young consumers spend more time using electronic content than watching TV.
                But instead of a decentralized system, we have a Web dominated by influential platforms driving the flow of information, much like traditional broadcast networks.</p> 
            <p>Reversal of Hypertext's Vision - 
                McLuhan's point that media revolve around when pushed to their limits is obvious: hypertext, as an interactive medium, has become homogenous and hegemonic.
                Instead of an interactive, user-defined web, it has become a passive consumption system through corporate-owned platforms.</p>
            <p>Future of Hypertext - 
                Hypertext is still capable of a true information revolution, but it requires structural transformation to prevent monopolization and ensure real participation.
                The dream of an interactive, decentralized virtual world remains possible if users reclaim control over content creation and delivery.
                </p>
            <p>Relevance to the Internet Today</p>
                <p>Centralization of the Web - 
                Concerns expressed by Moulthrop in terms of corporate control are even more relevant today. The likes of Google, Facebook, and Amazon mediate electronic interactions the same way broadcast systems controlled television.</p>
                <p>Social Media & Information Control - 
                    Although the Web enables people to create content (social media, blogging, YouTube), corporate control and algorithms dictate visibility, typically limiting true participatory debate.S\</p>
                <p>The War Between Open and Closed Systems - 
                    The early vision of an open exchange of ideas on the Internet is now in opposition to closed systems (social media, streaming) with profits and engagement at their core instead of open knowledge sharing.</p>
                <p>Hypertext in Modern Forms - 
                    Hypertext has moved beyond webpages to new digital formats such as interactive media, video games, and AI-narratives.
                    The shift towards multimedia and AI-generated content is now challenging what the future of user agency and digital literacy will be.</p>
                <p>Decentralization Movements - 
                    Efforts like blockchain-powered networks and open-source platforms (Mastodon, peer-to-peer web architecture) are attempting to restore the original decentralized hypertext vision but are being met with resistance by corporate internet oligarchs.
                    Moulthrop's critique of the failed "hypertext revolution" is still current today, because the battle between open, user-driven media and corporate control continues to be central to the digital agenda. The question lingers: can the Web ever achieve its revolutionary potential, or will it prove just another centralized, consumer-driven medium?
