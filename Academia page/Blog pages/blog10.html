                <p>Reflecting on how our coding practice matters within the context of decolonialism requires recognizing the embedded epistemologies, power dynamics, and assumptions that influence how we write code. The talk emphasizes that code is never neutral; each coding decision reflects a worldview shaped by cultural, social, and historical forces, often dominated by colonial and technocolonial paradigms.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>The Myth of Neutral Code</h4>
                    <p>Code is never neutral; each coding decision reflects a worldview shaped by cultural, social, and historical forces, often dominated by colonial and technocolonial paradigms. This means, in my own coding practice, I need to be acutely aware that the way I write code—how I design interactions, choose language, and implement features—carries ideological weight and impacts inclusivity, accessibility, and representation.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Critical Questions for Developers</h4>
                    <p>Decolonial awareness thus means questioning dominant assumptions, such as whose knowledge informs the design, who benefits from the technology, and what biases may be perpetuated, even unintentionally. Every line of code becomes a space for critical reflection about power and representation.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Technical Benefits of JavaScript</h4>
                    <p>Regarding my website development process and incorporating JavaScript, I had to reconsider not only the technical integration but also the implications of interaction design choices I make. Adding JavaScript allowed my site to be more dynamic and interactive, enabling user inputs to modify content, animations to respond to user behaviors, and more seamless navigation without page reloads.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Enhanced User Experience</h4>
                    <p>This improves user experience by streamlining interactions, making them feel more natural and responsive. The technical capabilities of JavaScript create possibilities for more engaging and fluid digital experiences that can better serve user needs.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Decolonial Lens on Interactivity</h4>
                    <p>However, from a decolonial lens, this enhanced interactivity invites reflection on accessibility—are these JavaScript features inclusive, performant on low-end devices or limited bandwidth, and culturally appropriate for diverse users? The question becomes not just "can I do this?" but "should I do this, and for whom?"</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Challenging One-Size-Fits-All Design</h4>
                    <p>Streamlining interaction design through JavaScript is thus not just a technical upgrade but a chance to critically assess whether the interactions respect diverse epistemologies and user needs rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all, colonial-influenced digital behavior.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Accessibility as Justice</h4>
                    <p>Considerations must extend beyond basic functionality to include performance on low-end devices, compatibility with limited bandwidth, and cultural appropriateness for diverse global users. This shifts the focus from technical sophistication to equitable access and inclusive design.</p>

                    <h4>Interrogating Our Code</h4>
                    <p>The development process becomes a continuous interrogation of what questions I am answering in my code, challenging the neutrality myth, and striving to create technology that is equitable, inclusive, and conscious of the broader socio-political system within which it operates.</p>

                    <h4>Beyond Technical Excellence</h4>
                    <p>Incorporating JavaScript into my web development helped me create smoother, more engaging user interactions, but it also requires me to maintain a critical awareness of the power structures and cultural assumptions embedded in my coding and design decisions.</p>

                <p>In summary, incorporating JavaScript into my web development helped me create smoother, more engaging user interactions, but it also requires me to maintain a critical awareness of the power structures and cultural assumptions embedded in my coding and design decisions. The development process becomes a continuous interrogation of what questions I am answering in my code, challenging the neutrality myth, and striving to create technology that is equitable, inclusive, and conscious of the broader socio-political system within which it operates.</p>

                    <h4>Key Principles for Decolonial Coding</h4>
                    <p><strong>Question Assumptions:</strong> Regularly examine whose knowledge systems inform your design decisions and who benefits from your technological choices.</p>
                    <p><strong>Prioritize Accessibility:</strong> Ensure your code works across diverse technological contexts, from high-end devices to limited bandwidth environments.</p>
                    <p><strong>Challenge Universality:</strong> Resist the impulse to create "universal" solutions that may actually reflect dominant cultural paradigms.</p>
                    <p><strong>Maintain Critical Awareness:</strong> Recognize that every technical decision carries ideological weight and impacts representation and inclusion.</p>
