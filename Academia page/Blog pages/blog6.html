                    <p>Studying web design has been an enjoyable and rewarding experience. The internet is an ever-evolving entity, and learning how websites are designed, structured, and optimized has given me a greater respect for the cyber world. It is fascinating to observe how an effectively structured site can boost satisfaction among users, display information succinctly, and even impact what people think about a company or individual.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>HTML Foundations</h4>
                    <p>My earlier experience in CAT has introduced me to HTML as second nature and intuitive. Understanding the fundamental operations of the computer and how it handles and displays information has served me well, making it easy to grasp concepts of HTML. Structuring pages, placing elements in it, and placement of content has been straightforward steps, verifying the importance of sensible organization in designing web pages.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Design Philosophy</h4>
                    <p>Functional and not form, and simplicity in place of complexity are factors in which I extremely stress regarding philosophy in web designing. A site should be easy to use, efficient at delivering content, and accessible to the masses. Aesthetics are important but never at the cost of usability. An ordered and tidy site enables users to find what they need without effort.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Future Learning Goals</h4>
                    <p>I look forward to learning CSS and JavaScript in the future as a way to further enhance web designing. Just as HTML provides one with a strong foundation, CSS will allow me to get more precise with the presentation of my site through looks, introducing structure to layout, color, text, and responsiveness. JavaScript will be used to create interactivity and dynamic aspects that enable me to build interactive user experiences.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="blog-section">
                    <p>This web design journey has been an exhilarating and educational experience. Every step, from coding a webpage in HTML to laying out future improvements in CSS and JavaScript, has only served to reinforce my passion for creating successful and well-crafted digital communities.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">Website 2 Reflection</h3>
                
                <div class="blog-section">
                    <p>Learning and applying CSS in the development of Website 2 has been an eye-opening step forward in my journey as a web designer. While HTML gave me the structural backbone of a website, CSS introduced a new layer of visual styling and precision that brought my projects to life. Styling a site is not just about aesthetics—it's about crafting an experience that communicates clarity, professionalism, and intent.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Visual Control & Precision</h4>
                    <p>CSS allowed me to gain full control over the visual layout and presentation of my website. From color schemes and typography to spacing, alignment, and responsiveness, every detail became a tool to convey tone and functionality. I found joy in experimenting with consistent styling rules using classes and IDs, and saw firsthand how thoughtful design choices can transform an average webpage into a polished product.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Design Consistency & Hierarchy</h4>
                    <p>One of the biggest lessons during this stage was the importance of consistency and hierarchy in design. CSS helped me define visual flow and guide user attention to the most important parts of the page. With Flexbox and Grid, I could organize content more intelligently, and using media queries allowed me to make my website responsive and accessible across different screen sizes.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Philosophy in Practice</h4>
                    <p>What made CSS exciting was how it supported my core design philosophy: functionality over form and simplicity over clutter. Through CSS, I could achieve clean designs that were not overloaded but still conveyed personality and intent. The styling process gave me an appreciation for restraint—how whitespace, subtle effects, and alignment can speak louder than crowded visuals.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="blog-section">
                    <p>Website 2 has marked a turning point where I could translate ideas into structured and styled visuals. With CSS, I learned how to think like a designer while still staying grounded in my commitment to user-centric, purposeful websites. CSS has empowered me to shape user experience more deliberately, and I look forward to using these skills to build digital spaces that are both beautiful and intuitive.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">Website 3 Reflection</h3>
                
                <div class="blog-section">
                    <p>Creating Website 3 marked a significant milestone in my web development journey, as it introduced me to the dynamic world of JavaScript. While HTML provided structure and CSS brought visual style, JavaScript gave my website life—it allowed me to make the site responsive to user actions, add functionality, and create richer, more engaging experiences.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Dynamic Functionality</h4>
                    <p>JavaScript allowed me to go beyond form and style to build user-driven behavior. Simple scripts like toggling menus, validating forms, or displaying alerts helped me understand how web pages react and adapt in real time. As I gained confidence, I ventured into more complex logic—event handling, DOM manipulation, and creating interactive features that responded instantly to user input.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>User Experience Enhancement</h4>
                    <p>One of the biggest insights I gained while working with JavaScript was the importance of feedback in user experience. Using JavaScript to confirm actions or guide users through interactive forms showed how powerful scripting can be in improving usability. These small touches made the site not only more functional but also more human, as it began to "communicate" with the user rather than simply display information.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Code Quality & Maintainability</h4>
                    <p>JavaScript became the bridge between my ideals of functionality and simplicity. I learned how to build features that felt natural, not forced—where interactivity served a clear purpose and enhanced navigation rather than complicating it. This phase also taught me the value of writing clean, reusable code and the importance of modularizing functions and exploring best practices.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Interactive Features</h4>
                    <p>Features like dynamic content loading, interactive carousels, and form validation brought Website 3 to life, transforming it into more than a display of content—it became an environment where users could explore, interact, and connect with ease. This level of interactivity aligned perfectly with my philosophy: every design choice should have a purpose, and every script should improve the user experience.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="blog-section">
                    <p>Looking ahead, I am excited to delve deeper into frameworks and libraries like React and Vue, which build upon JavaScript's foundation and allow for even more sophisticated interactivity. Website 3 stands as proof of how far I've come—from static pages to dynamic, user-focused design. JavaScript has opened a new world of possibilities, and I am eager to continue building websites that are not only functional and clean, but also intelligent and responsive to the needs of their users.</p>
