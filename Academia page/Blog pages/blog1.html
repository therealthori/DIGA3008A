                    <p>My experience with setting up Git was good but confusing due to my VS Code not having Git. However, I am very grateful that the tutors were able to help me set up my VSCode and Git. Publishing to Pages was easy, due to the use of git and the live server, it was very nice to navigate.</p>

                    <p>Alan Turing's paper asks the big question: "Can machines think?" But instead of trying to define "thinking," he suggests a simple test called the Imitation Game (now called the Turing Test).</p>
                    
                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h4>The Imitation Game (Turing Test)</h4>
                        <ul class="highlight-list">
                            <li>Someone asks questions of two hidden players: one human, and one machine.</li>
                            <li>If the human is unable to tell which is the machine, then the machine is "thinking" like the human.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h4>1. Machines Can Imitate Human Thinking</h4>
                        <p>Computers accept orders, but if they are able to answer questions like the human, then they can be called intelligent.</p>
                        
                        <h4>2. Objections (Disagreements) and Turing's Responses</h4>
                        <ul class="highlight-list">
                            <li>"Machines have no soul" - Turing claims this restricts what God would be able to do.</li>
                            <li>"Machines just follow rules, so they can't be creative" - But humans follow rules in thinking and learning too!</li>
                            <li>"Computers will never have emotions" - Turing claims that emotion is irrelevant; what does matter is whether the machine behaves like a human.</li>
                            <li>"Machines can't make mistakes" - But they can learn from errors and even "simulate" erring like a human being.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Machines Can Learn!</h4>
                        <p>Instead of teaching a machine to perform like an adult, why not teach it like a child? A learning machine could improve over time, as humans do.</p>

                    <h3>Turing's Prediction</h3>
                    <p>He believed that by the year 2000, computers would be so advanced that most people would not be able to tell if they were talking to a machine or a human.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Final Thought</strong> - Turing explains we should be comparing machines 'what they do' and not 'how they work' on the inside. If a machine acts like a human, then why not think that it is "thinking"?</p>

                    <p>October 29th, 1991, was the start of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) which was created by Tim Berners-Lee as it publicly links to the World Wide Web (WWW) which was also invented by Tim Berners-Lee. March 18th, 1992, was when Berners-Lee introduces the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), formally known as URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), as how web addresses are constructed as a standard to navigating decentralized networks.</p>
