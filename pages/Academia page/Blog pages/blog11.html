        <div class="blog-section">
            <p>As someone who spends a large part of my life on the internet—whether I'm creating websites, participating in online forums, or just browsing information—the notion of an ethical internet resonates strongly with me. Web design, to many, seems like an altogether technical field, but I've come to realize that every design decision we make has a very tangible moral implication. We're not just building code; we're shaping spaces where people live parts of their lives. Embracing ethical internet principles in my web design work has not only made me a more responsible creator but also restored my faith in the internet as a tool for justice, equity, and inclusion.</p>
        </div>

            <h3 class="section-title">Designing With Care and Responsibility</h3>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>From Technical to Ethical</h4>
                <p>Early on in my career as a web developer, I witnessed how easy it was to prioritize flashy features and smooth appearances over user well-being. Santa Clara University's introduction to Internet Ethics, however, opened my eyes. The internet is not just an infrastructure of technologies—it is a social and ethical environment. As the site concisely states, "The internet should be a place of freedom, trust, and human dignity" (SCU, n.d.).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Small Choices, Big Impact</h4>
                <p>This sentence resonated with me. It challenged me to think about how I collect information on users, how I present information, and how easy my sites are to use. I started making my notices about cookies more clear and ensuring my forms ask for less information. It may sound like a small thing, but these choices mean a lot—they are choices that show respect for the user.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title">Roger Silverstone's Legacy: The Internet as a Moral Environment</h3>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Media as Moral Landscape</h4>
                <p>Shani Orgad's tribute to Roger Silverstone, "The Internet as a Moral Space," provided me with deeper theoretical background. Silverstone advocated for an approach to the media—and hence the internet—as extensions of our shared moral landscape. The way we treat people on the internet and the networks we build either enrich or sully such a landscape (Orgad, 2007: 34).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Proper Distance in Digital Spaces</h4>
                <p>The concept that really appealed to me was Silverstone's vision of "proper distance." He argued that there is a desire for ethical online conversation that acknowledges the humanity of the "other" even when the other is screen-mediated. It is not enough to just create a platform that brings people together; we must create platforms that care. That has influenced how I construct online communities and comment spaces. I now believe that it is ethical to moderate—not to silence voices, but to let each voice be heard in a respectful way.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            <h3 class="section-title">Freedom and Equity in Digital Spaces</h3>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>The Myth of Public Digital Space</h4>
                <p>The more I thought about my own position as a designer, the more I noticed how many people are excluded from digital public life. Laura Stein's "Speech Without Rights" convinced me that the majority of online spaces aren't quite as public as one might think. Despite the promise that the internet would be a democratic space, Stein explains how courts prefer to regard platforms and services as being private property, where proprietors instead of the public control who gets to speak (Stein, 2008: 3).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Structural Inclusion vs. Visual Accessibility</h4>
                <p>This resonated with me. I had always thought of the internet as a kind of inclusive medium, but Stein's critique reminded me that ethical design must do more than make visual arrangements for accessibility—it must uphold structural inclusion. If my website is organized in such a way as to disable comments, shut out marginalized voices, or depend heavily on platforms that censor without appeal, then I am party to building a speech-constricting space.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Redistributing Power</h4>
                <p>That's why I began incorporating open-source platforms and community-based moderation tools in my web development. It's not a matter of giving people a voice—it's about redistributing power.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            <h3 class="section-title">Transparency and Trust: The Foundations of Digital Ethics</h3>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Beyond the Digital Veil</h4>
                <p>Transparency is another of my new values. Users today are more aware than ever, and they deserve to know what happens beyond the digital veil. Moral design means being open about where user data is being placed, with whom it is being shared, and with whom it might be shared.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Unconditional Responsibility</h4>
                <p>Silverstone's emphasis on unconditioned responsibility reminded me that trust is not transactional. We shouldn't care about privacy because users "give us something in return"—we should out of decency. As he argues, genuine ethical relationships aren't based on reciprocity, but on respecting the other human being (Orgad, 2007: 36). That's why I no longer bury privacy policies in footers—I try to present them clearly, prominently, and with respect.</p>

        <div class="blog-section">
            <h3 class="section-title">Accessibility and Inclusion: It's Not Just Compliance</h3>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>From Checkbox to Justice</h4>
                <p>I once viewed accessibility as a mere checkbox to tick off. But after studying the ethics of the internet, I came to understand that it is a form of justice. People with disabilities, users in low-bandwidth communities, and non-dominant language speakers all deserve equal access to information and potential.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Inclusive Design as Ethical Design</h4>
                <p>Santa Clara University website reminds us that "an ethical internet is an accessible one." That includes semantic HTML, semantic alt text, scalable fonts, and easy navigation—not as an afterthought, but as a natural part of the design process. Inclusive design is ethical design.</p>

        <div class="blog-section">
            <h3 class="section-title">The Ethical Internet Is Not a Utopia—But It's a Goal Worth Pursuing</h3>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Progress Over Perfection</h4>
                <p>It is easy to believe that striving for a moral internet is an illusion when surveillance capitalism, false information, and exclusion have such deep roots in our digital lives. But as a designer, I don't need to solve everything at once. I just need to do my contribution.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Building Better Digital Futures</h4>
                <p>Silverstone's legacy calls to mind that we are all part of a larger media environment. Every ethical decision I make helps the health of that environment—in the same way that planting a tree, I might never sit beneath, but someone else will be able to, helps.</p>
            </div>

            <p>As Stein reminds us, rights-free speech is no speech at all (Stein, 2008: 10). If my sites aren't demanding speech, safety, and equality, then they're failing their users. But if I can empower just one user to feel heard, safe, and empowered—then I'm more than a web designer. I'm building a better online future.</p>
