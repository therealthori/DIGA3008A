                    <p>Stuart Moulthrop's essay examines the advent of hypertext and its potential as a revolutionary new medium. By using Marshall McLuhan's paradigm of media analysis, he investigates what hypertext adds, replaces, recovers, and becomes when pushed to its limits.</p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="blog-section">
                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h4>Hypertext's Promise</h4>
                        <p>Hypertext was envisioned as an interactive, non-linear system that would allow users to read and write interactively, transcending books' rigid form. Early advocates such as Ted Nelson envisioned it as a means to democratize information, building an open and networked "docuverse" where users freely contributed and accessed information.</p>
                    </div>
    
                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h4>Commercialization & Corporate Influence</h4>
                        <p>Whereas hypertext was envisioned as a device for liberation and unencumbered sharing of ideas, it soon became centralized. Rather than a people-driven revolution, big business such as Sony and AOL have come to control online spaces, controlling access to content.</p>
                    </div>
    
                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h4>Hypertext vs. Traditional Media</h4>
                        <p>Moulthrop argues that hypertext is not replacing books but television, as young consumers spend more time using electronic content than watching TV. But instead of a decentralized system, we have a Web dominated by influential platforms driving the flow of information, much like traditional broadcast networks.</p>
                    </div>
    
                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h4>Reversal of Hypertext's Vision</h4>
                        <p>McLuhan's point that media revolve around when pushed to their limits is obvious: hypertext, as an interactive medium, has become homogenous and hegemonic. Instead of an interactive, user-defined web, it has become a passive consumption system through corporate-owned platforms.</p>
                    </div>
    
                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h4>Future of Hypertext</h4>
                        <p>Hypertext is still capable of a true information revolution, but it requires structural transformation to prevent monopolization and ensure real participation. The dream of an interactive, decentralized virtual world remains possible if users reclaim control over content creation and delivery.</p>

                        <h4>Centralization of the Web</h4>
                        <p>Concerns expressed by Moulthrop in terms of corporate control are even more relevant today. The likes of Google, Facebook, and Amazon mediate electronic interactions the same way broadcast systems controlled television.</p>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h4>Social Media & Information Control</h4>
                        <p>Although the Web enables people to create content (social media, blogging, YouTube), corporate control and algorithms dictate visibility, typically limiting true participatory debate.</p>
                    </div>
    
                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h4>The War Between Open and Closed Systems</h4>
                        <p>The early vision of an open exchange of ideas on the Internet is now in opposition to closed systems (social media, streaming) with profits and engagement at their core instead of open knowledge sharing.</p>
                    </div>
    
                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h4>Hypertext in Modern Forms</h4>
                        <p>Hypertext has moved beyond webpages to new digital formats such as interactive media, video games, and AI-narratives. The shift towards multimedia and AI-generated content is now challenging what the future of user agency and digital literacy will be.</p>
                    </div>
    
                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h4>Decentralization Movements</h4>
                        <p>Efforts like blockchain-powered networks and open-source platforms (Mastodon, peer-to-peer web architecture) are attempting to restore the original decentralized hypertext vision but are being met with resistance by corporate internet oligarchs.</p>
                    </div>
    
                    <p>Moulthrop's critique of the failed "hypertext revolution" is still current today, because the battle between open, user-driven media and corporate control continues to be central to the digital agenda. The question lingers: can the Web ever achieve its revolutionary potential, or will it prove just another centralized, consumer-driven medium?</p>

                    <h4>Interaction and the WWW</h4>
                    <p>Interaction and the WWW is a reflective analysis of interactivity on the internet, incorporating perspectives from noted thinkers like Aaron Smuts, Lev Manovich, Espen Aarseth, and Gonzalo Frasca. It challenges the broad use of "interactivity" and reduces it to something more meaningful‚Äîrequiring responsiveness, non-random behavior, and nontrivial effort that alters the experience.</p>
    
                    <p>Most insightful is the discussion of types of user interactions‚Äîmouse events, keyboard events, form events, and UI events‚Äîthat all shape digital experiences. The emphasis on how interaction can control, guide, and create meaning is thought-provoking, as it reminds us that web design is not just an exercise in usability but in meaningful influence.</p>
                    
                    <p>In general, this reflection accentuates the interactive nature of digital interactivity and the necessity of interpreting how users engage with technology. It's a great foundation for critical thinking about how digital worlds are established and experienced.</p>
